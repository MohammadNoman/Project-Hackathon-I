4.  **Core Ethical Principles (Justice and Fairness):**
    *   **Question:** How can algorithmic bias manifest in robot decision-making, and what steps can be taken during design and deployment to promote justice and fairness in robot interactions?
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Apply ethical principles to real-world robot applications.

5.  **Robot Safety Standards:**
    *   **Question:** Outline the primary purpose and key requirements of ISO 10218 in the context of industrial robot safety. How does it aim to protect human workers?
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Understand international robot safety standards and regulations.

6.  **Risk Assessment:**
    *   **Question:** Describe a methodology for identifying and mitigating risks associated with human-robot collaboration in a manufacturing setting. Provide an example of a specific risk and its mitigation strategy.
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Apply risk assessment techniques to robotic systems.

7.  **Ethical Challenges in Healthcare Robots:**
    *   **Question:** Identify and discuss two ethical dilemmas associated with the use of robots in elder care. How might these dilemmas be addressed through design or policy?
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Evaluate ethical challenges in specific robot application areas.

8.  **Ethical Challenges in Military Robots (LAWS):**
    *   **Question:** Explain the 'human in the loop' vs. 'human on the loop' debate concerning Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). What are the main ethical arguments for each side?
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Analyze the ethical implications of advanced robotic systems.

9.  **Designing for Transparency:**
    *   **Question:** Why is transparency and explainability crucial in the design of ethical robots? Provide an example where a lack of transparency could lead to ethical issues.
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Propose design principles for ethical and safe robots.

10. **Societal Impact (Economic):**
    *   **Question:** Discuss both the potential economic benefits and challenges (e.g., job displacement) of widespread robot adoption. How can societies prepare for these changes?
    *   **Learning Outcome:** Analyze the broader societal impact of robotics.

## Project Prompts

1.  **Ethical Robot Design Case Study:**
    *   **Prompt:** Choose a specific robot application (e.g., autonomous delivery robots, educational robots, search and rescue robots). Research existing ethical guidelines or debates related to this application. Then, propose a set of 3-5 ethical design principles tailored to your chosen robot, explaining your rationale for each. Your proposal should include considerations for autonomy, beneficence, and accountability.
    *   **Deliverable:** A short report (500-750 words) outlining the application, chosen principles, and a justification for each, referencing relevant concepts from Module 11.

2.  **Robot Safety Protocol Development:**
    *   **Prompt:** Imagine you are a safety engineer tasked with integrating a new collaborative robot into a small manufacturing facility. Develop a comprehensive safety protocol for its operation, drawing upon international safety standards (e.g., ISO/TS 15066) and risk assessment methodologies. Include aspects like hazard identification, risk mitigation strategies, emergency procedures, and human-robot interaction guidelines.
    *   **Deliverable:** A detailed safety plan document (including diagrams or flowcharts if appropriate) that addresses physical safety, data security, and human-robot collaboration.

3.  **AI-Native Textbook Interactive Scenario:**
    *   **Prompt:** Design an interactive scenario for an AI-Native Textbook that simulates an ethical dilemma in robotics. For example, a self-driving car facing the "trolley problem," or a companion robot detecting a user's distress and deciding whether to alert family.
    *   **Deliverable:** A script or outline for the interactive scenario, including:
        *   The setup (context, characters, robot involved).
        *   The dilemma presented to the user.
        *   Multiple choice options for the user's decision.
        *   Consequences for each choice, explaining the ethical implications based on Module 11 principles.
        *   Follow-up questions for reflection.

4.  **Policy Proposal for Robot Governance:**
    *   **Prompt:** Research the current regulatory landscape for robotics in a country or region of your choice (e.g., EU, USA, Japan). Identify a gap or a specific area where regulation is lacking or could be improved (e.g., liability for AI decision-making, data privacy for service robots). Draft a policy brief proposing a new regulation or an amendment to existing laws, justifying your proposal with ethical arguments and references to Module 11 concepts.
    *   **Deliverable:** A policy brief (750-1000 words) that includes an executive summary, problem statement, proposed solution, ethical justification, and potential impacts.

5.  **Public Perception and Robot Acceptance Campaign:**
    *   **Prompt:** Design a public awareness campaign aimed at improving understanding and ethical acceptance of a specific type of robot (e.g., elder care robots, agricultural robots) in a community. Consider how to address common fears or misconceptions, promote transparency, and build trust.
    *   **Deliverable:** A campaign proposal including target audience analysis, key messages, proposed activities (e.g., workshops, informational videos, public forums), and a justification for how your campaign aligns with ethical principles and fosters responsible robot integration.
