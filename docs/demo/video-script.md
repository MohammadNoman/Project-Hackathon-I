## Key Talking Points (Reference)

### Introduction Hook
- Emphasize "2030" aesthetic - futuristic, forward-thinking
- Highlight "AI-native" - not just digital, but intelligently designed
- Position as "redefining education" - innovative approach

### Platform Overview
- Stress comprehensiveness: 13 modules = complete curriculum
- Mention specific topics (ROS2, SLAM, ethics) to show breadth
- Visual richness: diagrams, code, interactive elements

### Chatbot Capabilities
- RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation (don't explain, just show)
- Speed: "instantly searches 13 modules"
- Accuracy: "cites exact sources with relevance scores"
- Tech credibility: Qdrant + OpenAI

### Context Selection (Unique Feature)
- This is the **differentiator** - spend time here
- Use phrase "game-changer" to emphasize importance
- Show, don't just tell: actual text selection → response
- "Laser-focused explanations" = precision

### Additional Features
- Authentication tied to personalization (background questions matter)
- Visual learning emphasis (26 diagrams)
- Modern UX expectations: responsive, dark mode

### Tech Stack & Closing
- Name-drop key technologies for credibility
- Repeat URL clearly
- Strong CTA: "Visit... the future is now"

## Music & Sound Design

### Background Music Recommendations
- **Genre**: Electronic, Tech House, Future Bass
- **Mood**: Uplifting, energetic, modern
- **BPM**: 120-130 (matches pacing)
- **Examples** (royalty-free sources):
  - "Technology" by Alexey Anisimov (YouTube Audio Library)
  - "Digital Horizon" by Scott Buckley
  - "Innovation" by AShamaluevMusic

### Sound Effects
- **Chatbot open**: Soft "whoosh" or slide-in sound
- **Text selection**: Subtle highlight sound
- **Response streaming**: Gentle typing/processing sound (optional)
- **Transitions**: Soft "swoosh" between scenes
- **Final CTA**: Light "ping" or notification sound

### Audio Levels
- **Narration**: -6dB to -3dB (primary, clear)
- **Music**: -20dB to -15dB (background, supports narration)
- **Sound effects**: -12dB to -8dB (noticeable but not distracting)

---

## Backup Plans & Contingencies

### If Recording Goes Over 90 Seconds
**Trim Priority Order**:
1. Reduce opening montage from 10s to 7s (cut repetitive visuals)
2. Shorten features montage (1:05-1:20) to 12 seconds (skip mobile view)
3. Reduce chatbot response wait time (use faster playback in editing)

### If Chatbot Doesn't Respond
**Fallback**:
- Pre-record a successful chatbot interaction
- Use video editing to splice in the response
- Alternative: Use mock data/static response for demo purposes

### If Live Demo Site is Down
**Fallback**:
- Record locally (localhost:3000)
- Ensure backend is running locally with indexed content
- In worst case, use screen recording of previous successful demo

### Technical Issues Checklist
- [ ] Backend not starting: Check port 8000 availability, review logs
- [ ] Frontend not loading: Clear npm cache, reinstall dependencies
- [ ] Chatbot not responding: Verify Qdrant connection, check API keys in .env
- [ ] Slow performance: Close other applications, restart services
