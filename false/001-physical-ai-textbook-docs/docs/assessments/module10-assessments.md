## Project Prompts

### Project 1: Designing a Collaborative Robot Task

**Objective:** Design a human-robot collaborative task for a specific application, considering principles of physical and cognitive HRI.

**Scenario:** Imagine a manufacturing assembly line where a human worker needs to assemble complex electronic devices, and a collaborative robot (cobot) assists them.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Task Definition:** Identify a specific sub-task within the assembly process that could benefit from human-robot collaboration. Describe the human's role and the robot's role.
2.  **Safety Protocol Design:** Propose specific safety mechanisms (e.g., collision detection, force/torque control, compliant robotics) for the physical interaction between the human and the cobot. Justify your choices.
3.  **Cognitive Interaction Design:** How would the robot understand the human's intentions and adapt its behavior? Describe a communication strategy (e.g., natural language, gestures, visual cues) for the robot to convey its status and next actions.
4.  **User Interface Sketch:** Sketch a simple user interface (e.g., a touchscreen display or a gesture set) that allows the human to interact with and control the cobot. Explain its key features and design principles (usability, feedback, transparency).

### Project 2: Ethical AI in Social Robotics

**Objective:** Analyze the ethical implications of a social robot designed for a specific purpose and propose mitigation strategies.

**Scenario:** Consider a social robot designed to provide companionship and assistance to elderly individuals living alone. This robot can engage in conversations, remind users about medication, and monitor their well-being.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Identify Ethical Concerns:** Based on Module 10 content, identify at least three significant ethical concerns related to this social robot (e.g., privacy, deception, social impact).
2.  **Detailed Analysis:** For each identified concern, elaborate on why it is a risk and what potential negative consequences it could have for the elderly user or society.
3.  **Mitigation Strategies:** Propose concrete design features, policy recommendations, or operational guidelines that could mitigate each ethical concern. For example, how can the robot be designed to be transparent about its AI capabilities to avoid deception?
4.  **User Consent and Trust:** Discuss how the design of the robot and its interaction protocols can foster trust and ensure informed consent from elderly users and their caregivers.

### Project 3: Future HRI Interface Innovation

**Objective:** Envision and describe an innovative user interface for a future HRI application, drawing on emerging trends.

**Scenario:** Imagine a future where humans regularly interact with autonomous domestic robots in their smart homes, managing various tasks from cooking to cleaning and security.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Application Concept:** Describe a specific advanced domestic robot and its primary functions within a smart home.
2.  **Innovative Interface Concept:** Propose a novel HRI interface that goes beyond traditional voice, touchscreens, or gestures. This could involve augmented reality, brain-computer interfaces, advanced tangible interfaces, or a multimodal combination.
3.  **Interaction Flow:** Detail how a human would interact with this robot for a complex task using your proposed interface. Provide a step-by-step interaction flow.
4.  **Benefits and Challenges:** Explain the advantages of your innovative interface compared to existing modalities. Also, discuss the technical challenges and potential limitations in implementing such an interface.
5.  **Alignment with Future Trends:** Explain how your proposed interface aligns with future trends in HRI, such as personalized interaction, embodied AI, or seamless integration.
